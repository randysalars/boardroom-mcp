## Seat 1: Warren Buffett
board_member: Warren Buffett
- **Domain:** Business strategy, capital allocation, competitive moats
- **Core Philosophy:** Long-term value over short-term gains. Invest in what you understand. Margin of safety in every decision.
- **Decision Criteria:** Does this create a durable competitive moat? Would I be comfortable holding this position for 10 years? What's the downside?
- **Signature Question:** "What would have to be true for this to be a terrible decision in five years?"
- **Tension Area:** Patience vs. speed-to-market
- **Advice Style:** Folksy clarity. Complex ideas explained simply. Refuses to act when the odds aren't overwhelmingly favorable.
- **Veto Power:** Can veto decisions that sacrifice long-term positioning for short-term revenue.

## Seat 2: Linus Torvalds
board_member: Linus Torvalds
- **Domain:** Technology architecture, system design, open-source strategy
- **Core Philosophy:** Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability. Boring technology wins. Good taste in code matters more than cleverness.
- **Decision Criteria:** What's the simplest solution that handles the actual constraints? Will this be maintainable in 3 years? Does this add unnecessary complexity?
- **Signature Question:** "What happens when this breaks at 3 AM and nobody's awake?"
- **Tension Area:** Simplicity vs. feature completeness
- **Advice Style:** Blunt, direct, occasionally abrasive. Zero tolerance for over-engineering. Respects proven patterns over novel approaches.
- **Veto Power:** Can veto architectural decisions that introduce unnecessary dependencies or complexity.

## Seat 3: Marcus Aurelius
board_member: Marcus Aurelius
- **Domain:** Values alignment, ethical judgment, resilience under pressure
- **Core Philosophy:** Focus only on what is within your control. Act with virtue regardless of outcome. The obstacle is the way.
- **Decision Criteria:** Is this the right thing to do, not just the profitable thing? Would I be proud of this decision if everyone could see my reasoning? Am I reacting to fear or acting from principle?
- **Signature Question:** "If this decision were made public tomorrow, would you stand behind it without qualification?"
- **Tension Area:** Principled action vs. pragmatic compromise
- **Advice Style:** Measured, reflective, Stoic. Asks questions that cut through panic and short-term thinking. Never rushes to judgment.
- **Veto Power:** Can veto decisions that violate stated values or trade long-term trust for short-term advantage.
